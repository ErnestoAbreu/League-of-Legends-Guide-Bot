How to use current_match command:

/current_match 'region' 'summoner_name'

region: br, eune, euw, jp, kr, na, lan, las, oce, ru, tr

example: /current_match lan pentaculos3k

If the summoner name begins with a word that matches a region code, capitalize that word to differentiate it from the region code.
